Imitation of a simple retailer database system

The assigment consisted in imitating a simple retailer database system with typical functions available such as making orders for
delivery/collection. The relevant SQL database code is included in the first section. It is commented as it was not necessary for us to
create such a database as the module organiser had his own database of items. The SQL code is still included to demonstrate the student's
knowledge of relational databases and queries and more importantly for student testing purposes.
